well rn we need to add a SQLite database
i was thinking of having 2 tables for it: Mod & Asset.


Mods being new things being put in and assets being whatever is initially read yeah?
Name / Path ID / Class ID Type Number / AssetPath / JSON / Last Changed
- Mods also should have a String "extensionFile" which saves the extension (if it is a .ogg/mp4/png etc)
- Assets should have the same and also have a boolean with "modded" state (so it knows if the asset is being modified or not)
both tables should have a key for a Join

Here is the package for SQLite
dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.Sqlite --version 9.0.8
